### Recap
* Java is a compiled language. You can use `javac` and `java` to compile and run your code.
* Java is an **object-oriented language**. Every Java file must contain either a `class`, `interface`, or `enum`.
* When running a Java program, the main method runs. This main method can call other methods/classes in the program.
* `Git` is a **version control system** that tracks the history of a set of files in the form of commits.
* Commit often and use informative commit messages.
* Pull from the skeleton remote repository to get or update starter code for assignments.
